# Google Book Search - React 

## Description

This is a simple project to Search books and save them to your own library. It is powered by Google books and built as a single page application with React and React router dom. 

This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

I have had the oportunity to utilise block code in components for both Saved page and Search Page books, and utilise custom hooks to fetch and utilise data. This Project also demonstrates connecting the front client with a back end server.
